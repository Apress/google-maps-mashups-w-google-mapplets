Welcome!

This source code accompanies the Apress book Google Maps Mashups with Google Mapplets
http://www.apress.com/book/view/9781430209959

There are a few code samples for each of the five chapters of the book. 
You will find both Google Mapplet code (JavaScript) and PHP source code in the 
included examples.  

Most of the PHP code requires PHP5, SimpleXML and Curl to run properly. 
You can find more information on SimpleXML and Curl here:

SimpleXML - http://www.php.net/simplexml
Curl - http://us3.php.net/curl
